# skorchxW-B
Automate ML experiments with skorch and W&amp;B

As more high-quality libraries and frameworks are beoming open sourced, machine and deep learning have become a part of mainstream toolkit for developers and practitioners. Kaggle, the world's largest community of data scientists and machine learning practitioners is dominated by the usage of scikit-learn machine learning library. But with the increasing complexity of problem statements, the usage of deep neural networks for such competitions is also on the rise. Due to this, competitors need to use multiple frameworks for experimentation, sklearn for all the classical machine learning realted task and tensorflow or pytorch for experimenting with deep neural networks. In this project, we'll solve this problem by using a skorch, which is an sklearn compatible wrapper around pytorch and while we are at it, we'll also try to automate the process of selection of best neural network architecture from a given set by using hyper-parameter sweeps and visualizations provided by weights and biases.
